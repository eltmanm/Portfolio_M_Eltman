## This site is dedicated to the discussion and display of the projects created or worked on by Mike Eltman. Every here and there expect updates on ongoing projects, as far as new materials that have been created, or decisions made about their continuation. With any luck, access to some of my projects will be available via the site, perhaps through GitHub repository links or files and programs. See blog pages here for content, and see the forums section if you want to express thoughts on this yourself.
