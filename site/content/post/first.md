title: Elemental and Monumental

Here's a Project I've been working on since 2013. I've been calling it Gauntlet of Elements. Originally, I tried to make it using all sorts of mechanics and assets that I don't think I would ever be able to finish on my own. Especially with the lack of experience I had back then. Since then, I've made a lot of progress, but I still can't make this thing work as I originally intended, and that's fine. I settled on a new vision for it, and for a class assignment in Artificial Intelligence, my group mates and I tried to make that new vision a reality. At least part of it. Ultimately, we've got a start, and while we may never get a finish, we've discussed attempting to continue going forward. In lieu of a proper screenshot or actual gameplay yet, seeing as my JavaScript experience to embed here isn't ready yet, I'll just post a couple assets we made for the running of the game.
