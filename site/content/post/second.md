title: Fakemon Project
---

Another project I've had going for a while now. The idea behind this project was to design a fan-made Pokémon-inspired game centered around the undergraduate college I'm currently enrolled at. Since it's not quite official, and hasn't really been talked about with the administration much, I'll keep things anonymous as to which college. As the game currently stands, we've designed over 200 different creatures, several towns each shaped like one of the buildings on campus, about 60 soundtrack pieces at least begun, written out progression for a lot of the game, and added several assets on the side. I did say 'we' here, since this is a group project of about 10 people at present. and never fear, we do have the code for the game functionality taken care of, it hasn't been all designing assets, though a lot of it has been. For this game we are using a software engine called RPGMakerXP, and have found a package for it that mimics the mechanics of Pokémon pretty accurately. We had to add text files and our own assets, and change a few things, but it is in fully working condition at present.
